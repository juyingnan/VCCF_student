# Nuclei Segmentation using Vanderbilt Segmentation

- Nuclei segmentation using Vanderbilt methodology with Auto thresholding using Opencv toolbox
- The segmentation is using grayscale image but can be implemented in RGB mode as well

## Histogram Normalization
- For images of different intensities and contrast, histogram normalization is performed to normalize the image intensity
- Auto thresholding has been performed on test images to see accuracy

## Brightness Normalization
- For images of different intensities and contrast, brightness normalization is performed to normalize the image brightness
- Auto thresholding has been performed on test images to see accuracy
